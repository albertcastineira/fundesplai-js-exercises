/* 
The next loop will execute once because its a do while. This will cause:
The first iteration the variable i will decrease by one, and the variable numero will increase one.รง
The second iteration and the next ones will execute the else condition and this will increase numero to 4.
Once numero is 4 it will stop the loop.
